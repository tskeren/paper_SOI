abstract = {With their attractive intrinsic properties, such as morphology, autoassembling properties, and tailorability, nano-objects could provide alternative and innovative routes to current microelectronics and nanoelectronics. Further insight on their electrical properties, especially in terms of statistics and reproducibility, as well as on their potential integration into silicon-based electronics is, however, often required to be able to fully exploit their potential. This paper proposes an innovative approach using a generic structure allowing the study of nano-objects electrical properties. Regarding the nano-objects integration, a homogeneous approach is presented with the in situ fabrication of atomic wires as a possible planar interconnection system. A heterogeneous approach is described as well with the characterization and preliminary integration of biological material, such as deoxyribonucleic acid-based nanowires or amyloid fibers.

abstract = {We evaluate the electron spin relaxation time connected with the exchange and annihilation interaction between electrons and free and bound holes. We show that this mechanism can playa determining role under conditions of optical orientation of electrons in semiconductors. We construct a theory of the electron spin relaxation when holes are strongly scattered by impurities and taking into account the fast relaxation of the hole spin. We show that the rate of electron spin relaxation due to holes is proportional to the time of interaction with the holes, i.e., the time during which the distance between them is less than the electron wavelength. Under conditions when this time equals the time of diffusion of holes through the interaction region, strong scattering of holes leads to a decrease in the electron spin relaxation time. On the other hand, under conditions when the hole spin relaxation time becomes less than the interaction time, strong hole spin relaxation leads to an increase in the electron spin relaxation time due to an efficient averaging of the hole spin.},

abstract = {We present a procedure for calibrated complex impedance measurements and dielectric quantification with scanning microwave microscopy. The calibration procedure works in situ directly on the substrate with the specimen of interest and does not require any specific calibration sample. In the workflow tip-sample approach curves are used to extract calibrated complex impedance values and to convert measured S11 reflection signals into sample capacitance and resistance images. The dielectric constant of thin dielectric SiO2 films were determined from the capacitance images and approach curves using appropriate electrical tip-sample models and the $\epsilon$r value extracted at f = 19.81 GHz is in good agreement with the nominal value of $\epsilon$r ∼ 4. The capacitive and resistive material properties of a doped Si semiconductor sample were studied at different doping densities and tip-sample bias voltages. Following a simple serial model the capacitance-voltage spectroscopy curves are clearly related to the semiconductor depletion zone while the resistivity is rising with falling dopant density from 20 $\Omega$ to 20 k$\Omega$. The proposed procedure of calibrated complex impedance measurements is simple and fast and the accuracy of the results is not affected by varying stray capacitances. It works for nanoscale samples on either fully dielectric or highly conductive substrates at frequencies between 1 and 20 GHz.},

abstract = {We study transport through two quantum dots in series. Electron-electron interactions are taken into account in the capacitive model with an additional interdot capacitance. The tunneling rates between the dots and the outside reservoirs are assumed to be weak, we therefore treat it perturbatively and derive a master equation. The inter-dot tunneling is treated in two limits: weak inter-dot tunneling is included perturbatively, whereas in the opposite limit we assume that there is only one level in the dot in the relevant energy range such that the Hamiltonian of the dots can be diagonalized exactly. We calculate the current through the structure as a function of the two gate voltages. The well-known Coulomb oscillations of a single dot are changed into a characteristic structure of boomerang-like shape. The transport and gate voltages can be time-dependent, and in this case we find that the dependence of the Coulomb oscillations on the two gate voltages allows us to identify which level dominates the transport.},

abstract = {We investigate the ability to introduce strain into atomic-scale silicon device fabrication by performing hydrogen lithography and creating electrically active phosphorus delta-doped silicon on strained silicon-on-insulator (sSOI) substrates. Lithographic patterns were obtained by selectively desorbing hydrogen atoms from a H resist layer adsorbed on a clean, atomically flat sSOI(001) surface with a scanning tunnelling microscope tip operating in ultra-high vacuum. The influence of the tip-to-sample bias on the lithographic process was investigated allowing us to pattern feature-sizes from several microns down to 1.3 nm. In parallel we have investigated the impact of strain on the electrical properties of P:Si delta-doped layers. Despite the presence of strain inducing surface variations in the silicon substrate we still achieve high carrier densities ({\textgreater} 1.0 x 10(14) cm(-2)) with mobilities of similar to 100 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). These results open up the possibility of a scanning-probe lithography approach to the fabrication of strained atomic-scale devices in silicon.},

In this work, we use thin (monolayers thick) room temperature grown silicon layers, so-called locking layers, to limit dopant segregation in highly phosphorus doped silicon monolayers. We present secondary ion mass spectroscopy and atom probe tomography measurements that demonstrate the effectiveness of locking layers in suppressing P segregation. Scanning tunneling micrographs of the surface of the locking layer show that the growth is epitaxial, despite the low growth temperature, while magnetotransport measurements reveal a 50$\backslash${\%} decrease in the active carrier density. We show that applying a finely tuned rapid thermal anneal can restore the active carrier density to 3.4 × 1014 cm–2 while maintaining ultra sharp dopant profiles.

abstract = {Specific surfaces allowing Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) investigations are required for the successful development of atomic nanostructures. Surface contamination, atomic roughness and defects density must be controlled in order to ensure the reliability of advanced UHV experiments. Surface preparation is a key parameter and is usually conducted in-situ in the UHV chamber. However the surface preparation requires a complex protocol. A microelectronic clean room environment enables the particles density control and enables 200 mm wafer scale developments, especially Si(001)-(2x1):H surface reconstruction. However, this passivated surface is reactive and can be easily deteriorated, particularly during transportation. Consequently, a nanopackaging solution is proposed in order to provide a preserving environment for transportation. The nanopackaging process consists in the direct bonding of two passivated silicon surfaces, and is followed by a wafer dicing step into 1cm2 dies. Samples can be stored, shipped and in-situ opened without additional treatment. Furthermore, these samples can provide a reliable surface onto which molecular grafting can be accomplished. The fabrication modules and the associated characterization results will be described as well as atomic nanostructure manipulations and especially the grafting of a self-assembled monolayer using supercritical carbon dioxide as a medium.},

abstract = {Spintronics, or spin electronics, involves the study of active control and manipulation of spin degrees of freedom in solid-state systems. This article reviews the current status of this subject, including both recent advances and well-established results. The primary focus is on the basic physical principles underlying the generation of carrier spin polarization, spin dynamics, and spin-polarized transport in semiconductors and metals. Spin transport differs from charge transport in that spin is a nonconserved quantity in solids due to spin-orbit and hyperfine coupling. The authors discuss in detail spin decoherence mechanisms in metals and semiconductors. Various theories of spin injection and spin-polarized transport are applied to hybrid structures relevant to spin-based devices and fundamental studies of materials properties. Experimental work is reviewed with the emphasis on projected applications, in which external electric and magnetic fields and illumination by light will be used to control spin and charge dynamics to create new functionalities not feasible or ineffective with conventional electronics.},

abstract = {Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) lithography has recently demonstrated the ultimate in device scaling with buried, conducting nanowires just a few atoms wide and the realization of single atom transistors, where a single P atom has been placed inside a transistor architecture with atomic precision accuracy. Despite the dimensions of the critical parts of these devices being defined by a small number of P atoms, the device electronic properties are influenced by the surrounding 10(4) to 10(6) Si atoms. Such effects are hard to capture with most modeling approaches, and prior to this work no theory existed that could explore the realistic size of the complete device in which both dopant disorder and placement are important. This work presents a comprehensive study of the electronic and transport properties of ultra-thin ({\textless}10 nm wide) monolayer highly P $\delta$-doped Si (Si:P) nanowires in a fully atomistic self-consistent tight-binding approach. This atomistic approach covering large device volumes allows for a systematic study of disorder on the physical properties of the nanowires. Excellent quantitative agreement is observed with recent resistance measurements of STM-patterned nanowires [Weber et al., Science, 2012, 335, 64], confirming the presence of metallic behavior at the scaling limit. At high doping densities the channel resistance is shown to be insensitive to the exact channel dopant placement highlighting their future use as metallic interconnects. This work presents the first theoretical study of Si:P nanowires that are realistically extended and disordered, providing a strong theoretical foundation for the design and understanding of atomic-scale electronics.},

abstract = {We present a study of nanopattern formation on polycrystalline Ni surfaces upon low energy Ar ion bombardment. At low angles of ion incidence an isotropic, rough morphology develops on the surface while at grazing incidence a ripple structure parallel to the ion beam direction is formed (so-called perpendicular mode ripples). To explain this behavior we propose a model which is based on a combination of (a) surface roughening due to sputter yield variation between different crystalline grains and (b) anisotropic nonlinearity resulting from the oblique angle bombardment. By computer simulations we show that the combination of these two phenomena excellently reproduces the experimental behavior, in particular the dependence of the surface morphology on the ion incidence angle. Importantly, the formation of ripples at grazing incidence does not involve any linear instability, in strong contrast to the present model of the ripple formation process.},

We observe a number of different dopant-related features that fall into two classes, which we call As1 and As2. When imaged in occupied states, the As1 features appear as anisotropic protrusions superimposed on the silicon surface topography and have maximum intensities lying along particular crystallographic orientations. In empty-state images the features all exhibit long-range circular protrusions. The images are consistent with buried dopants that are in the electrically neutral (D0) charge state when imaged in filled states, but become positively charged (D+) through electrostatic ionization when imaged under empty-state conditions, similar to previous observations of acceptors in GaAs. Density functional theory calculations predict that As dopants in the third layer of the sample induce two states lying just below the conduction-band edge, which hybridize with the surface structure creating features with the surface symmetry consistent with our STM images. The As2 features have the surprising characteristic of appearing as a protrusion in filled-state images and an isotropic depression in empty-state images, suggesting they are negatively charged at all biases. We discuss the possible origins of this feature.},

At 4.2°K, the magnetoresistance effect is negative and tends toward saturation with increasing magnetic field strength for impurity concentrations greater than 5×1018 cm-3.

The four contacts have different separations ({\$}d{\$} = 9, 12, 16 and 29 nm) to the central 6 nm {\$}\backslashtimes{\$} 6 nm QD island, leading to different tunnel and capacitive coupling. Cryogenic transport measurements in the Coulomb-blockade (CB) regime are used to characterize these tunnel barriers. We find that field enhancement near the apex of narrow dopant leads is an important effect that influences both barrier breakdown and the magnitude of the tunnel current in the CB transport regime. From CB-spectroscopy measurements, we extract the mutual capacitances between the QD and the four contacts, which scale inversely with the contact separation {\$}d{\$}. The capacitances are in excellent agreement with numerical values calculated from the pattern geometry in the hydrogen resist. We show that by engineering the source-drain tunnel barriers to be asymmetric, we obtain a much simpler excited-state spectrum of the QD, which can be directly linked to the orbital single-particle spectrum.},

abstract = {The ability to control matter at the atomic scale and build devices with atomic precision is central to nanotechnology. The scanning tunnelling microscope can manipulate individual atoms and molecules on surfaces, but the manipulation of silicon to make atomic-scale logic circuits has been hampered by the covalent nature of its bonds. Resist-based strategies have allowed the formation of atomic-scale structures on silicon surfaces, but the fabrication of working devices-such as transistors with extremely short gate lengths, spin-based quantum computers and solitary dopant optoelectronic devices-requires the ability to position individual atoms in a silicon crystal with atomic precision. Here, we use a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy and hydrogen-resist lithography to demonstrate a single-atom transistor in which an individual phosphorus dopant atom has been deterministically placed within an epitaxial silicon device architecture with a spatial accuracy of one lattice site. The transistor operates at liquid helium temperatures, and millikelvin electron transport measurements confirm the presence of discrete quantum levels in the energy spectrum of the phosphorus atom. We find a charging energy that is close to the bulk value, previously only observed by optical spectroscopy.},

abstract = {We report the study of single dangling bonds (DBs) on a hydrogen-terminated silicon (100) surface using a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope. By investigating samples prepared with different annealing temperatures, we establish the critical role of subsurface arsenic dopants on the DB electronic properties. We show that when the near-surface concentration of dopants is depleted as a result of 1250 ?C flash anneals, a single DB exhibits a sharp conduction step in its I(V) spectroscopy that is not due to a density of states effect but rather corresponds to a DB charge state transition. The voltage position of this transition is perfectly correlated with bias-dependent changes in the STM images of the DB at different charge states. Density functional theory calculations further highlight the role of subsurface dopants on DB properties by showing the influence of the DB-dopant distance on the DB state. We discuss possible theoretical models of electronic transport through the DB that could account for our experimental observations.},

abstract = {To expand the capabilities of semiconductor devices for new functions exploiting the quantum states of single donors or other impurity atoms requires a deterministic fabrication method. Ion implantation is a standard tool of the semiconductor industry and we have developed pathways to deterministic ion implantation to address this challenge. Although ion straggling limits the precision with which atoms can be positioned, for single atom devices it is possible to use post-implantation techniques to locate favourably placed atoms in devices for control and readout. However, large-scale devices will require improved precision. We examine here how the method of ion beam induced charge, already demonstrated for the deterministic ion implantation of 14{\^{A}} keV P donor atoms in silicon, can be used to implant a non-Poisson distribution of ions in silicon. Further, we demonstrate the method can be developed to higher precision by the incorporation of new deterministic ion implantation strategies that employ on-chip detectors with internal charge gain. In a silicon device we show a pulse height spectrum for 14{\^{A}} keV P ion impact that shows an internal gain of 3 that has the potential of allowing deterministic implantation of sub-14{\^{A}} keV P ions with reduced straggling.},

We first present some of the limitations imposed on the current cobalt silicide process because of the constant scaling, of the introduction of new substrate geometries (i.e. thin silicon on insulator) and of the modifications to the substrate material (i.e. SiGe). We then discuss the advantages of NiSi and for each of the CoSi 2 limitations, we point out why Ni is believed to be superior from the point of view of material properties, miscibility of phases and formation mechanisms. Discussion follows on the expected limitations of NiSi and some of the possible solutions to palliate these limitations. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The approach is physical and intuitive rather than formal and pedantic. Theories are presented to explain experimental results. This textbook has been written with both students and researchers in mind. Its emphasis is on understanding the physical properties of Si and similar tetrahedrally coordinated semiconductors. The explanations are based on physical insights. Each chapter is enriched by an extensive collection of tables of material parameters, figures, and problems. Many of these problems "lead the student by the hand" to arrive at the results.The major changes made in the fourth edition include: an extensive appendix about the important and by now well-established deep center known as the DX center, additional problems and the solutions to over fifty of the problems at the end of the various chapters.Some of the solutions contain extensions via discussion about topics of current interest in the field of semiconductor physics, such as spin-orbit coupling and k-linear band dispersion.},

abstract = {Double quantum dots are convenient solid-state platforms to encode quantum information. Two-electron spin states can be detected and manipulated using quantum selection rules based on the Pauli exclusion principle, leading to Pauli spin blockade of electron transport for triplet states. Coherent spin states would be optimally preserved in an environment free of nuclear spins, which is achievable in silicon by isotopic purification. Here we report on a deliberately engineered, gate-defined silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor double quantum dot system. The electron occupancy of each dot and the inter-dot tunnel coupling are independently tunable by electrostatic gates. At weak inter-dot coupling we clearly observe Pauli spin blockade and measure a large intra-dot singlet-triplet splitting {\textgreater} 1 meV. The leakage current in spin blockade has a peculiar magnetic field dependence, unrelated to electron-nuclear effects and consistent with the effect of spin-flip cotunneling processes. The results obtained here provide excellent prospects for realising singlet-triplet qubits.},

Here we use radio frequency reflectometry to measure singlet-triplet states of a few-donor Si:P double quantum dot and demonstrate that the exchange energy can be tuned by at least two orders of magnitude, from 20 $\mu$eV to 8 meV. We measure dot-lead tunnel rates by analysis of the reflected signal and show that they change from 100 MHz to 22 GHz as the number of electrons on a quantum dot is increased from 1 to 4.

abstract = {We study low-temperature transport properties of two-dimensional (2D) Si tunnel diodes, or Si Esaki diodes, with a lateral layout. In ordinary Si Esaki diodes, interband tunneling current is severely limited because of the law of momentum conservation, while nanoscale Esaki diodes may behave differently due to the dopants in the narrow depletion region, by atomistic effects which release such current limitation. In thin-Si lateral highly dopedpndiodes, we find clear signatures of interband tunneling between 2D-subbands involving phonon assistance. More importantly, the tunneling current is sharply enhanced in a narrow voltage range by resonance via a pair of a donor- and an acceptor-atom in the pn junction region. Such atomistic behavior is recognized as a general feature showing up only in nanoscale tunnel diodes. In particular, a donor-acceptor pair with deeper ground-state energies is likely to be responsible for such a sharply enhanced current peak, tunable by external biases.},

This tunability arises because electron spins can be loaded through an orbital excited state. Using a theory that includes excited states of the dot and energy-dependent tunneling, we find that a global fit to the loading rate and spin-up fraction is in good agreement with the data.},

abstract = {We used DFT to study the energetics of the decomposition of alane, AlH3, on the Si(001) surface, as the acceptor complement to PH3. Alane forms a dative bond with the raised atoms of silicon surface dimers, via the Si atom lone pair. We calculated the energies of various structures along the pathway of successive dehydrogenation events following adsorption: AlH2, AlH and Al, finding a gradual, significant decrease in energy. For each stage, we analyse the structure and bonding, and present simulated STM images of the lowest energy structures. Finally, we find that the energy of Al atoms incorporated into the surface, ejecting a Si atom, is comparable to Al adatoms. These findings show that Al incorporation is likely to be as precisely controlled as P incorporation, if slightly less easy to achieve.},

In its ultimate limit, information is stored in the spin state of a single electron, at which point also quantum information processing becomes a possibility. Here we demonstrate the manipulation, transport and read-out of individual electron spins in a linear array of three semiconductor quantum dots. First, we demonstrate single-shot read-out of three spins with fidelities of 97{\%} on average, using an approach analogous to the operation of a charge-coupled-device (CCD). Next, we perform site-selective control of the three spins thereby writing the content of each pixel of this "Single-Spin CCD". Finally, we show that shuttling an electron back and forth in the array hundreds of times, covering a cumulative distance of 80 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m, has negligible influence on its spin projection. Extrapolating these results to the case of much larger arrays, points at a diverse range of potential applications, from quantum information to imaging and sensing.},

The temperature dependence of lattice-scattering mobility is found from conductivity to be T−2.6 for electrons and T−2.3 for holes. From conductivity mobility and intrinsic conductivity, it is found that carrier concentration at any temperature below 700°K is given by the expression: np=1.5×1033T3exp(−1.21kT).

A method of making ohmic contacts to buried III-V films using silicide metallurgies has been established. NiSi/Si/III-V dual heterojunction contact structures are found to be optimal for integration. These structures allow contact resistivities to be controlled by Si/III-V interfaces and eliminate interactions between the buried III-V device and metal layers. Using a modified transmission line method (TLM) test structure fabricated using standard CMOS processing techniques, the specific contact resistivities of Si/GaAs and Si/InxGa1-xAs interfaces are extracted. The relationship between specific contact resistivity and heterojuntion barrier width is considered. Among the structures tested in this work, p-type Si/GaAs and n-type Si/InxGa1-xAs yielded the lowest contact resistivities. Using the p-type Si/GaAs interface, a GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs laser with NiSi top contact is demonstrated, confirming the feasibility of NiSi/Si/III-V contact structures for III-V devices.},

The silicon nanowires were grown on p-type Si substrates using Au-catalyzed vapor?liquid?solid growth and in situ n-type doping. Electrical measurements reveal Esaki diode characteristics with peak current densities of 3.6 kA/cm2, peak-to-valley current ratios of up to 4.3, and reverse current densities of up to 300 kA/cm2 at 0.5 V reverse bias. Strain-dependent current?voltage (I?V) measurements exhibit a decrease of the peak tunnel current with uniaxial tensile stress and an increase of 48{\%} for 1.3 GPa compressive stress along the ?111? growth direction, revealing the strain dependence of the Si band structure and thus the tunnel barrier. The contributions of phonons to the indirect tunneling process were probed by conductance measurements at 4.2 K. These measurements show phonon peaks at energies corresponding to the transverse acoustical and transverse optical phonons. In addition, the low-temperature conductance measurements were extended to higher biases to identify potential impurity states in the band gap. The results demonstrate that the most likely impurity, namely, Au from the catalyst particle, is not detectable, a finding that is also supported by the excellent device properties of the Esaki diodes reported here.},

The tunnel coupled reservoir has the advantage of a large effective lever arm ({\~{}}35{\%}) allowing us to independently extract a neutral donor charging energy {\~{}}62 +/- 17meV.

The components are in constant ratio to each other for a given donor species but junctions formed using Sb gave relatively lower i0 currents than did junctions formed with P- or As-doped material. The three current components have very similar bias dependence which, empirically, turns out to be accurately described by Vexp(- beta 'V), where beta ' is a constant for a given junction. Part of the exponential factor represents the bias dependence of the tunneling probability, the remainder enters into the "effective density of states" function. The true peak voltage is given by 1 / beta '. The experimental current-voltage curves are compared with each of Kane's theories; the first is for undistorted band edges while the second takes account of the band edge tails in very impure semiconductors. Good agreement is obtained using the latter theory, both as to the over-all shape of the curves and the actual values of the peak voltages.},

abstract = {A scanning tunneling microscopy investigation of the morphological evolution of Pt(111) upon removal of 0.2 to 680 atomic layers by 1 keV Xe+ ion bombardment at normal incidence and at temperatures between 600 and 800 K is reported. The surface is found to become unstable in the temperature interval investigated. The destabilization of Pt(111) is most probably due to a step edge barrier for the attachment of a vacancy to an ascending step. Adatom production during ion bombardment enhances the destabilization of the surface. A qualitative change in roughness evolution is observed around 700 K, signified by an increase of the growth exponent from 0.40 to about 0.58. While below this temperature roughness buildup is due to pit formation, above 700 K it is initiated by remainders, left after vacancy island coalescence. The change in roughness evolution is caused by the onset of step atom detachment. For large removed amounts and above 700 K the surface exhibits an extended temperature regime of phase coexistence between a rough and a flat surface phase. The characteristic length scale of the surface morphology increases with the removed amount according to a power law with a temperature independent exponent of 0.28 +/- 0.02. This coarsening is due to step edge diffusion, rather than step atom detachment. The morphologies kinetically facet for the lower investigated temperatures. Possible origins for this slope selection are analyzed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Delmo2009,
abstract = {Recent discoveries of large magnetoresistance in non-magnetic semiconductors have gained much attention because the size of the effect is comparable to, or even larger than, that of magnetoresistance in magnetic systems. Conventional magnetoresistance in doped semiconductors is straightforwardly explained as the effect of the Lorentz force on the carrier motion, but the reported unusually large effects imply that the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully explored. Here we report that a simple device, based on a lightly doped silicon substrate between two metallic contacts, shows a large positive magnetoresistance of more than 1,000 per cent at room temperature (300 K) and 10,000 per cent at 25 K, for magnetic fields between 0 and 3 T. A high electric field is applied to the device, so that conduction is space-charge limited. For substrates with a charge carrier density below approximately 10(13) cm(-3), the magnetoresistance exhibits a linear dependence on the magnetic field between 3 and 9 T. We propose that the observed large magnetoresistance can be explained by quasi-neutrality breaking of the space-charge effect, where insufficient charge is present to compensate the electrons injected into the device. This introduces an electric field inhomogeneity, analogous to the situation in other semiconductors in which a large, non-saturating magnetoresistance was observed. In this regime, the motions of electrons become correlated, and thus become dependent on magnetic field. Although large positive magnetoresistance at room temperature has been achieved in metal-semiconductor hybrid devices, we have now realized it in a simpler structure and in a way different from other known magnetoresistive effects. It could be used to develop new magnetic devices from silicon, which may further advance silicon technology.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015 American Physical Society. Despite the importance of Si:P $\delta$-doped wires for modern nanoelectronics, there are currently no computational models of electron transport in these devices. In this paper we present a nonequilibrium Green's function model for electronic transport in a $\delta$-doped wire, which is described by a tight-binding Hamiltonian matrix within a single-band effective-mass approximation. We use this transport model to calculate the current-voltage characteristics of a number of $\delta$-doped wires, achieving good agreement with experiment. To motivate our transport model we have performed density-functional calculations for a variety of $\delta$-doped wires, each with different donor configurations. These calculations also allow us to accurately define the electronic extent of a $\delta$-doped wire, which we find to be at least 4.6 nm.},

abstract = {We have studied three low-dimensional systems with sub-micron dimensions: a single polyacetylene (PA) nanofiber; a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)-rope; and a lithographically prepared stripe of poly(2-methoxy-5-(2-ethyl hexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV). In each case, the sample was contacted to four-probe electrodes, with 100-nm spacing and various electronic transport properties such as the I-V characteristics, the temperature dependence of resistivity and the gate voltage dependence of the transport current were measured. The PA nanofiber was found to be non-ohmic with a room temperature conductivity of ???0.1 S/cm. Its carriers were found to be hole-like with charge carrier mobility of ?? = 7.76 ?? 10-2 cm2/Vs. For the SWNT-rope, the temperature-dependence of resistivity exhibited signatures of a Luttinger liquid for temperatures below 30 K. With varying gate voltage, periodic peaks were seen in the nanotube current which would normally be attributed to the effects of Coulomb blockade. Interestingly, these peaks show three-way splitting, similar to observations in triple quantum dot experiments. The MEH-PPV stripe, which was produced using electron beam lithography, had I-V characteristics similar to that of a large band-gap semiconductor. In the high field region, these characteristics could be explained in terms of a single carrier device model which considers the field-dependent mobility along with space charge limited conduction (SCLC). All three samples can be considered as field-effect transistors (FETs), with potential use in future high density integrated electronic devices. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

We integrated this doping technique with ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope lithography and femtosecond laser ablation micron-scale lithography, and demonstrated basic components of donor-based nanoelectronic circuitry such as wires and tunnel gaps. By repetition of controlled doping cycles we have shown that stacking of multiple Ge:P two-dimensional electron gases results in high electron densities in Ge ({\textgreater}10(20) cm(-3)). Because of the strong vertical electron confinement, closely stacked 2D layers - although interacting - maintain their individuality in terms of electron transport. These results bode well towards the realization of nanoscale 3D epitaxial circuits in Ge comprising stacked 2DEGs and/or atomic-scale Ge:P devices with confinement in more dimensions.},

Scaling the supply voltage reduces the energy needed for switching, but the field-effect transistors (FETs) in today's integrated circuits require at least 60 mV of gate voltage to increase the current by one order of magnitude at room temperature. Tunnel FETs avoid this limit by using quantum-mechanical band-to-band tunnelling, rather than thermal injection, to inject charge carriers into the device channel. Tunnel FETs based on ultrathin semiconducting films or nanowires could achieve a 100-fold power reduction over complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, so integrating tunnel FETs with CMOS technology could improve low-power integrated circuits.},

abstract = {The impact of dopant atoms in transistor functionality has significantly changed over the past few decades. In downscaled transistors, discrete dopants with uncontrolled positions and number induce fluctuations in device operation. On the other hand, by gaining access to tunneling through individual dopants, a new type of devices is developed: dopant-atom-based transistors. So far, most studies report transport through dopants randomly located in the channel. However, for practical applications, it is critical to control the location of the donors with simple techniques. Here, we fabricate silicon transistors with selectively nanoscale-doped channels using nano-lithography and thermal-diffusion doping processes. Coupled phosphorus donors form a quantum dot with the ground state split into a number of levels practically equal to the number of coupled donors, when the number of donors is small. Tunneling-transport spectroscopy reveals fine features which can be correlated with the different numbers of donors inside the quantum dot, as also suggested by first-principles simulation results.},

Here we demonstrate, by high-fidelity (93{\%}) electrical spin readout, that a long relaxation time T1 of about 2 s, at B=1.2 T and T≈100 mK, is also characteristic of electronic spin states associated with a cluster of few phosphorus donors, suggesting their suitability as hosts for spin qubits. Owing to the difference in the hyperfine coupling, electronic spin transitions of such clusters can be sufficiently distinct from those of a single phosphorus donor. Our atomistic tight-binding calculations reveal that when neighbouring qubits are hosted by a single phosphorus atom and a cluster of two phosphorus donors, the difference in their electron spin resonance frequencies allows qubit rotations with error rates ≈10(-4). These results provide a new approach to achieving individual qubit addressability.},

For phosphorus and arsenic the room‐temperature resistivity of the films was found to be higher after annealing at lower temperatures. By successively annealing the same sample at lower and higher temperatures, the resistivity would repeatedly increase and decrease, indicating reversible dopant segregation at the grain boundaries. Hall measurements were used to estimate the number of active dopant atoms within the grains and the number of atoms segregated at the grain boundaries as a function of annealing temperature. A theory of segregation in systems of small particles has been developed. Using this theory, the heat of segregation of arsenic and phosphorus in polycrystalline silicon was calculated.

The thickness of the dielectric SiO(2) staircase ranged from 10 to 200 nm. The quantitative capacitance values determined from the PNA reflection amplitude were compared to control measurements using an external capacitance bridge.

It remains a matter of individual taste as to whether or not the term “Fermi level” should be used in solution. The equivalence of the Fermi level to the redox potential is demonstrated by simple thermodynamic arguments, uncluttered by the possibly confusing paraphernalia of specialized cycles.

abstract = {Specific surfaces allowing the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) creation of electronic interconnects and atomic nanostructures are required for the successful development of novel nanoscale electronic devices. Atomically flat and reconstructed Si(0 0 1):H surfaces are serious candidates for that role. In this work such Si:H surfaces were prepared in a cleanroom environment on 200 mm silicon wafers with a hydrogen bake and were subsequently bonded together to ensure the surface protection, and allow their transportation and storage for several months in air. Given the nature of the bonding, which was hydrophobic with weak van der Waals forces, we were then able to de-bond them in UHV. We show that the quality of the de-bonded Si:H surface enables the "at will" construction of sophisticated and complex dangling bond (DB) nanostructures by atomically precise scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip induced desorption of hydrogen atoms. The DB structures created on slightly doped Si:H samples were characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) performed at 4 K. Our results demonstrate that DB nanostructures fabricated on UHV de-bonded Si(0 0 1):H wafers could be directly incorporated in future electronics as interconnects and parts of nanoscale logic circuits. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate epitaxial growth up to nominally 25 nm, at 250 °C, with analysis at successive growth steps using STM and cross section TEM to reveal the nature and quality of the epitaxial growth. STM images indicate that growth morphology of both Si on Si and Si on H-terminated Si (H: Si) is epitaxial in nature at temperatures as low as 250 °C. For Si on Si growth at 250 °C, we show that the Si epitaxial growth front maintains a constant morphology after reaching a specific thickness threshold. Although the in-plane mobility of silicon is affected on the H: Si surface due to the presence of H atoms during initial sub-monolayer growth, STM images reveal long range order and demonstrate that growth proceeds by epitaxial island growth albeit with noticeable surface roughening.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

These effects have been studied in silicon and germanium Esaki junctions using special equipment which plots continuously on an X-Y recorder the bias dependence of the current I, conductance G=(dI/dV), and (d2I/dV2)G-2. Twelve phonon and phonon-combination energies have been definitely revealed on the Si junctions and seven in the Ge junctions. Assignments of these energies are given; those for the Si junctions are mostly combinations of the transverse acoustic or optic phonons with intervalley scattering phonons and optic phonons of zero wave number. In the silicon junctions, in addition to the phonon-induced structure, over certain ranges of forward bias there are prominent oscillations in the second derivative curves. The origin of these oscillations is not satisfactorily understood though they have been tentatively ascribed to the Stark splitting of the energy bands in the high electric field of the junction.},

abstract = {As the size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink, the normally random distribution of the individual dopant atoms within the semiconductor becomes a critical factor in determining device performance--homogeneity can no longer be assumed. Here we report the fabrication of semiconductor devices in which both the number and position of the dopant atoms are precisely controlled. To achieve this, we make use of a recently developed single-ion implantation technique, which enables us to implant dopant ions one-by-one into a fine semiconductor region until the desired number is reached. Electrical measurements of the resulting transistors reveal that device-to-device fluctuations in the threshold voltage (Vth; the turn-on voltage of the device) are less for those structures with ordered dopant arrays than for those with conventional random doping. We also find that the devices with ordered dopant arrays exhibit a shift in Vth, relative to the undoped semiconductor, that is twice that for a random dopant distribution (- 0.4 V versus -0.2 V); we attribute this to the uniformity of electrostatic potential in the conducting channel region due to the ordered distribution of dopant atoms. Our results therefore serve to highlight the improvements in device performance that can be achieved through atomic-scale control of the doping process. Furthermore, ordered dopant arrays of this type may enhance the prospects for realizing silicon-based solid-state quantum computers.},

abstract = {We have grown by reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition Si/Si 1-yC y/Si heterostructures for electrical purposes. The incorporation of substitutional carbon atoms into Si creates a carrier confinement in the channel region of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistors. Indeed, tensile strain Si 1-yC y layers present a type II band alignment with Si, with a conduction band offset of the order of 60 meV per at.{\%} of substitutional carbon atoms. For small SiH 3CH 3 flows, all the incoming carbon atoms are incorporated into substitutional sites. At 600°C, when the SiH 3CH 3 flow increases, the substitutional carbon concentration saturates at 1.12{\%}. Meanwhile, the total carbon concentration C T still increases, following a simple law: C T/(1-C T)=0.88 *[F(SiH 3CH 3)/F(SiH 4)]. This is a sign that a growing number of C atoms incorporates into interstitial sites. The hydrogenated chemistry adopted does not enable one to achieve selectivity over SiO 2-masked wafers, but does not however generate any adverse loading effect. We have integrated Si/Si 1-yC y/Si stacks (which have been shown to be stable versus conventional gate oxidations and electrical activation anneals) into the channel region of ultrashort gate length (50 nm) nMOS transistors. Secondary ions mass spectrometry profiling has shown that C atoms segregate from the Si 1-yC y layer into the Si cap and the SiO 2 gate, but also that they block the diffusion paths of B coming from the antipunch through layer towards the gate, generating very retrograde doping profiles. The addition of C leads to a degradation of the electron mobility which seems to be linked to the high amount of C atoms into interstitial sites. {\textcopyright} 2002 American Institute of Physics. {\textcopyright} 2002 American Institute of Physics.},
